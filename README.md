I use nix home manager across linux and osx systems. Understandably, some gui
packages are needed in some cases, but not others. What is the best way to
implement home manager such that I can a) maximize configuration reuse, b)
accommodate systems that have guis and associated packages installed as well as
those that don't (i.e. cli only), and differentiate between OSX and linux
systems as the homedirs are different paths. OSX systems can be apple silicon or
intel. In OSX cases I do not need a CLI-only profile.Oh, and I'd like to use
flakes with this.```

To achieve your goals with Nix Home Manager—maximizing configuration reuse,
accommodating GUI and CLI-only systems, differentiating between macOS (Darwin)
and Linux, and integrating Flakes—here’s a structured approach. This setup
assumes you’re comfortable with Nix’s declarative syntax and Flakes’
reproducible builds.

1. Project Structure

Start with a Flake-based setup for reproducibility. Here’s a suggested directory
structure:

```nix
home-manager-config/
├── flake.nix
├── flake.lock
├── home.nix              # Common configuration
├── modules/
│   ├── gui.nix          # GUI-specific settings
│   ├── cli.nix          # CLI-only settings
│   └── os-specific.nix  # OS-specific path logic
├── hosts/
│   ├── linux-gui.nix    # Linux with GUI
│   ├── linux-cli.nix    # Linux CLI-only
│   └── darwin.nix       # macOS (GUI only)
└── lib/
    └── custom.nix       # Custom helper functions
```

2. Flake Setup (flake.nix)
Define inputs and outputs to pull in Home Manager and handle system-specific builds.

```nix
{
  description = "Home Manager configuration with Flakes";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable";
    home-manager = {
      url = "github:nix-community/home-manager";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, home-manager, ... }@inputs:
    let
      lib = nixpkgs.lib;
      mkHome = { system, username, modules }: home-manager.lib.homeManagerConfiguration {
        pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; };
        modules = modules ++ [
          ./home.nix
          {
            home = {
              username = username;
              homeDirectory = lib.mkDefault (if system == "x86_64-darwin" || system == "aarch64-darwin"
                                             then "/Users/${username}"
                                             else "/home/${username}");
            };
          }
        ];
      };
    in {
      homeConfigurations = {
        "linux-gui" = mkHome {
          system = "x86_64-linux";
          username = "yourusername";
          modules = [ ./hosts/linux-gui.nix ];
        };
        "linux-cli" = mkHome {
          system = "x86_64-linux";
          username = "yourusername";
          modules = [ ./hosts/linux-cli.nix ];
        };
        "darwin-intel" = mkHome {
          system = "x86_64-darwin";
          username = "yourusername";
          modules = [ ./hosts/darwin.nix ];
        };
        "darwin-apple" = mkHome {
          system = "aarch64-darwin";
          username = "yourusername";
          modules = [ ./hosts/darwin.nix ];
        };
      };
    };
}```

Inputs: Nixpkgs and Home Manager are pinned via Flakes.

Outputs: Define configurations for each system type. The mkHome function
abstracts the boilerplate, setting the home directory based on OS.

Systems: Explicitly support x86_64-linux, x86_64-darwin, and aarch64-darwin.

3. Common Configuration (home.nix)

This is your reusable base configuration, applied to all systems.

```nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }:
{
  # Basic packages for all systems
  home.packages = with pkgs; [
    htop
    tmux
    neovim
  ];

  programs = {
    git.enable = true;
    zsh.enable = true;
  };

  # Import modular configurations
  imports = [
    ./modules/cli.nix
    ./modules/os-specific.nix
  ];
}```

4. Modular Configurations

Separate GUI, CLI, and OS-specific logic into reusable modules.

modules/cli.nix
CLI tools shared across all systems.

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:
{
  home.packages = with pkgs; [
    fzf
    ripgrep
  ];
}```

modules/gui.nix
GUI-specific packages and settings.

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:
{
  home.packages = with pkgs; [
    firefox
    alacritty
  ];

  programs.vscode.enable = true;
}```

modules/os-specific.nix
Handle OS-specific paths and settings.

```nix
{ config, pkgs, lib, ... }:
{
  config = lib.mkMerge [
    (lib.mkIf (pkgs.stdenv.isLinux) {
      # Linux-specific settings
    })
    (lib.mkIf (pkgs.stdenv.isDarwin) {
      home.packages = with pkgs; [ rectangle ]; # macOS-specific app
    })
  ];
}```

5. Host-Specific Configurations

Tie everything together for each use case.
hosts/linux-gui.nix
Linux with GUI.

```nix

{ config, pkgs, ... }:
{
  imports = [ ../modules/gui.nix ];
  # Add any Linux-GUI-specific overrides
}```

hosts/linux-cli.nix
Linux CLI-only.

```nix

{ config, pkgs, ... }:
{
  # No GUI module imported, CLI-only by default
}```

hosts/darwin.nix
macOS (GUI only, for both Intel and Silicon).

```nix

{ config, pkgs, ... }:
{
  imports = [ ../modules/gui.nix ];
  # macOS-specific overrides if needed
}```

6. Activation
Initialize the Flake: nix flake init (if starting fresh) or use the flake.nix above.

Apply a configuration, e.g., for Linux GUI:

```bash
home-manager switch --flake .#linux-gui```

For macOS Silicon:

```bash
home-manager switch --flake .#darwin-silicon```

7. Key Features

- Reuse: home.nix and modules like cli.nix are shared across all configs.
- GUI/CLI Flexibility: Import gui.nix only where needed (Linux GUI and macOS).
- OS Differentiation: os-specific.nix and dynamic homeDirectory handle Linux vs. macOS paths.
- Flakes: Ensures reproducible builds across systems.
- Apple Silicon/Intel: Same darwin.nix works for both, as Nixpkgs abstracts the architecture.

8. Tips

- Testing: Use nix flake check to validate your setup.
- Overrides: Add host-specific tweaks in the hosts/ files as needed.
- Updates: Run nix flake update to refresh dependencies.

This setup balances modularity and reuse while cleanly separating concerns. Let
me know if you want to refine any part further!
